## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

From this challenge, I was able to learn about box-shadow and how to center a container.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css

body{
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    min-height: 100vh;
    place-content: center;
    align-items: center;
}

.card {
  box-shadow: 8px 8px 0px 2px hsl(0, 0%, 0%);
}

```

### Continued development

Though I was able to finish up this challenge, I still have to learn more about:
- viewport height
- viewport width
- box-shadow

### Useful resources

- [Box-shadow](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/b/box-shadow/) - This helped me learn about box-shadows. I like the simplicity in explanation and the numerous examples.
- [Place-content](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/place-content) - This article helped me in understanding place-content property. It includes interactive examples and codes.
